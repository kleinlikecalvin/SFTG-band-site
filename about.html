      <h2>A Gruesome History</h2>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col" id="about-content">
          <p>
            In the beginning of time, (literally, this band is old as shit) a
            man who is upright in more ways than just bass named Fabian Grave
            and a previous/forever honorary member/BFFL named Demonted Tony were
            drawn towards the sweet and sensual music of subcultures. They
            joined forces with other friends to create the band of their
            nightmares, <strong>Straight From The Grave</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            In their original stomping grounds of Anaheim they played many a
            show and ran through many a member. BUT! They never let the
            inconsistencies of the band stand in the way of their passion for
            playing sick (and I mean sick) jams for any ears willing to listen.
          </p>
          <p>
            Flash forward past some haituses and more unforseen circumstances...
            Straight From The Grave finally settled into a solid line-up which
            included guitar maestro Alex Sin and drum god Nikki Dixxx. With such
            a face melting combination of musicians SFTG was finally ready to
            get super serious. They almost immediately went to work writing a
            full length album and revamping their old favorites from the SFTG's
            lengthy history. Once the jams had been perfected and tested on the
            mindless zombie following they enslaved with their charms, they put
            out a full length album (which is available in the
            <a href="./shop.html">online store</a>).
          </p>
          <p>
            With a new album as fiery as the depths of hell, Straight From The
            Grave played a gajillion new sick fests and shows with more local
            groups like Dante and The Hellhounds, Mask, and Catacomb Rockers!
            Eventually Demonted Tony returned to hell to continue serving Satan
            for the rest of his days along with his five gremlins. Following his
            departure, Nikki Dixxx was possessed by the seemingly indestructable
            spirit of illness itself. While it was sad to see her fade into its
            grasp, THE SHOW MUST GO ON! So Straight From The Grave brought in
            Andy Suicide and the show did in fact <em>go on</em>. Unfortunately,
            for more reasons than there is space to address, COVID-19 cut their
            winning streak abruptly short. But don't fret! They still have many
            plans for the future and are VERY open to accepting new and creative
            opportunities to persist during the foreseeable future!
          </p>

            future seances or exorcisms then feel free to send them a
